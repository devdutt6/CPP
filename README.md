# DSA with C++

This repo will have the code that i do, algorithm that i learn, and problems which i will practice.

There is a directory for each DS and each directory will probably have three files **easy, medium, hard** signifing problem solution's difficulty for that perticular DS related problems.

## Plan

- I try to document the each day's learning from now on(09-12-2022) which you will find in [DAILY.md](DAILY.md).
- Will first cover the easy and medium problems of a Data Structures(DSs) on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) then will move to hard after covering all DSs first.
- Then after first 3 or 4 weeks i will also participate in Leetcode's [Weekly Contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/) and will try to rankup every week.
- And how will i approach the problems, so it would go like first i will just try to write the **brute force** then will explore the ways to **optimize** it.
- After writting solutions i will look at the solutions written by others in Discussion section and will try to learn from it.

## Resources

- So i am following the [Striver's SDE sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/) for learning Data Structures and Algorithm you can also check out his youtube channel [takeUForward](https://www.youtube.com/c/takeUforward).
- This one [youtube video](https://youtu.be/oz9cEqFynHU) that i found was by [Tren Black](https://www.youtube.com/@TrenBlack) and it is soo good in explaining DSA in 15 minutes is soo incredible really if your are finding your-self stuck somewhere is learning DSA this video will inspire you to move forward. May not inspire you but certainly inspired me to resume my learning journey.
- I will keep adding others which i find good.
