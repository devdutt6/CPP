// Q. There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows. The stalls are located on a straight line at positions x1,â€¦.,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). We want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?
