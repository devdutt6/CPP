# Daily Learnings

## Notes
- Try to devide problems like if problem is sorting think comparison between just two numbers and then write that code then goto main problem and code it.
- `auto` automatic type assigner in cpp, it might save us from some hazards ;).
- `iterators` are important to understand it will be very helpful moving further.
-


## Covered topics and algos
- Patterns(Basic ones)
- STL (Standard Template Library)
  - Pair, Vector, List, Dequeue, Stack, Queue, PQ, Set, MultiSet, UnorderedSet, Map, MultiMap, UnorderedMap, Some algos
- Basic recursion, Math, Hashing and Logical thinking.
- Easy Array Problems.
  - Reversal algorithm for left and right shieft n elements.

## Day

### DAY-1(12-12-22)
Revision of the STL(Standard Template Library) and C language concepts.
Some of the sorting techniques and some basic programs from folder [progs](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/progs).

### DAY-2(13-12-22)
STL Completed revision with its daily use algorithms, containers and iterators.
Covered lower_bound and upper_bound functions with a small [exercise](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/stl/bound_exercise.cpp).

### DAY-3(14-12-22)
Revised all the sorting algorithms like bubble, insertion, merge, quick, selection.
Got started by codeing small problems like factorial, fibbonaci, palindrom etc.

### DAY-4(15-12-22)
Easy Array Problems in can be found in directory [array/easy](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/array/easy).
