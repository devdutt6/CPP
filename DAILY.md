# Daily Learnings

## Notes
- Try to devide problems like if problem is sorting think comparison between just two numbers and then write that code then goto main problem and code it.

## Covered topics and algos
- Patterns(Basic ones)
- STL (Standard Template Library)
  - Pair, Vector, List, Dequeue, Stack, Queue, PQ, Set, MultiSet, UnorderedSet, Map, MultiMap, UnorderedMap, Some algos

### DAY-2(13-12-22)
STL Completed revision with its daily use algorithms, containers and iterators.
