# Daily Learnings

## Notes
- Try to devide problems like if problem is sorting think comparison between just two numbers and then write that code then goto main problem and code it.
- `auto` automatic type assigner in cpp, it might save us from some hazards ;).
- `iterators` are important to understand it will be very helpful moving further.
- `Binary search` is a part/member of `Divide and Conqure` algorithm.
- Think where will the pointers be pointing after executing binary search on some search space some answer you might find some answers there.(upper bound, lower bound answers at pointers after the loop was terminated).
- If you are stuck somewhere write down the problem you are facing just write it, its not the problem statement, i am talking about the problem exactly you need to know it has tobe done. Like to sort you have to check are all the element before it should be small.

## Day

### DAY-1(12-12-22)
Revision of the STL(Standard Template Library) and C language concepts.
Some of the sorting techniques and some basic programs from folder [progs](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/progs).

### DAY-2(13-12-22)
STL Completed revision with its daily use algorithms, containers and iterators.
Covered lower_bound and upper_bound functions with a small [exercise](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/stl/bound_exercise.cpp).

### DAY-3(14-12-22)
Revised all the sorting algorithms like bubble, insertion, merge, quick, selection.
Got started by codeing small problems like factorial, fibbonaci, palindrom etc.

### DAY-4(15-12-22)
Easy Array Problems in can be found in directory [array/easy](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/array/easy).

### DAY-5, 6(16/17-12-22)
Continue with Easy Array Problems.

### DAY-7 (18-12-22)
Getting started with binary search with the simple 1D arrays. The practice code will be in [BS](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/BS). Did 2 problems this GFG is fkin [annoying](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/floor-in-a-sorted-array-1587115620/1?track=DSASP-Searching&amp%3BbatchId=154&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=collab_striver_ytdescription&utm_campaign=floor-in-a-sorted-array) there was no example for true test case and no explaination too.

### DAY-8, 9 (19/20-12-22)
Binary search continue with easy problems.

### DAY-10, 11 (22/23-12-22)
Binary search in 1D array.

### DAY 12, 13 (24/25-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D matrix completed and started binary search in search space.

### DAY 14 (26-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D problem 4 done.

### DAY 15 (27-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D problem number 5 done.

### DAY 16,17 (28, 29-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D problem number 6 done.

### DAY 18 (30-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D problem number 7 median of two sorted done.

### DAY 19 (31-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D problem number 8 aggresive cows done.

### DAY 20 (1-1-23)
Binary Search in 2D problem number 9 bookallocation done.

### DAY 21, 22 (2, 3-1-23)
Binary Search in 2D problem number 10 largest sub array sum still pending cause learning Next.js almost finished.

### Had to take a break for a week cause was not feelingwell

### DAY 22-25 (7-10,-1-23)
Got started with string very easy problems but getting handson with string first time so its taking time.

### Missed 11-1-23
Went to see the PSM100 exibition.

### DAY 26 (12-1-23)
Continued with the string problems the easy ones.

### damn! i took a unintentional break
January fking brezzed.
Krushnapal's surgery, psm100, and started with css and was spent time on doing that now shiefting focus from that and back to grind.

### DAY 20 (1-2-23)
Continue with the string and read some OS from most asked Interview questions.

### DAY 21(2-2-23)
String did only one problem which was too easy Atoi.

### DAY N(2-12-23)
Finished Striver's sheet and started solving POTDs 1st day was moderate 2nd was hard couldnt even do the moderate one.

### Day N+3(10-12-23)
First of all need to revise the concepts from the sheet and then will again start with POTDs and then contest.
