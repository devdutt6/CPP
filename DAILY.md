# Daily Learnings

## Notes
- Try to devide problems like if problem is sorting think comparison between just two numbers and then write that code then goto main problem and code it.
- `auto` automatic type assigner in cpp, it might save us from some hazards ;).
- `iterators` are important to understand it will be very helpful moving further.
- `Binary search` is a part/member of `Divide and Conqure` algorithm.
- Think where will the pointers be pointing after executing binary search on some search space some answer you might find some answers there.(upper bound, lower bound answers at pointers after the loop was terminated).


## Covered topics and algos
- Patterns(Basic ones)
- STL (Standard Template Library)
  - Pair, Vector, List, Dequeue, Stack, Queue, PQ, Set, MultiSet, UnorderedSet, Map, MultiMap, UnorderedMap, Some algos

- Easy Array Problems.
  - Reversal algorithm for left and right shieft n elements.
- Binary Search
  - BS in 1D array
  - BS in 2D matrix
  - BS in search space

## Day

### DAY-1(12-12-22)
Revision of the STL(Standard Template Library) and C language concepts.
Some of the sorting techniques and some basic programs from folder [progs](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/progs).

### DAY-2(13-12-22)
STL Completed revision with its daily use algorithms, containers and iterators.
Covered lower_bound and upper_bound functions with a small [exercise](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/stl/bound_exercise.cpp).

### DAY-3(14-12-22)
Revised all the sorting algorithms like bubble, insertion, merge, quick, selection.
Got started by codeing small problems like factorial, fibbonaci, palindrom etc.

### DAY-4(15-12-22)
Easy Array Problems in can be found in directory [array/easy](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/array/easy).

### DAY-5, 6(16/17-12-22)
Continue with Easy Array Problems.

### DAY-7 (18-12-22)
Getting started with binary search with the simple 1D arrays. The practice code will be in [BS](https://github.com/devdutt6/CPP/tree/main/BS). Did 2 problems this GFG is fkin [annoying](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/floor-in-a-sorted-array-1587115620/1?track=DSASP-Searching&amp%3BbatchId=154&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=collab_striver_ytdescription&utm_campaign=floor-in-a-sorted-array) there was no example for true test case and no explaination too.

### DAY-8, 9 (19/20-12-22)
Binary search continue with easy problems.

### DAY-10, 11 (22/23-12-22)
Binary search in 1D array.

### DAY 12, 13 (24/25-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D matrix completed and started binary search in search space.

### DAY 14 (26-12-22)
Binary Search in 2D problem 4 done.
